## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I've learned to use animation, transition. And using background-size to have the best behavior I can do.
In responsive design using clamp and website Utopia to calculate the margin.


### Continued development

I'm going to work on the clamp method with Utopia tools to calculate margin, padding, etc ...
And work on transiton, animation.


### Useful resources

- [Mozilla mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Very useful.
- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) - To have a better responsive design.
